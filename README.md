# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance

## Table of Contents

## Project Description
This project focuses on extracting loan payment data from a database in the cloud (an AWS Relational Database). It is then converted into a local csv file and datas pandaframe to later be transformed and analysed.

The data is first converted to formatting which allows for easier data analysis.Information such as datatypes, statistical values and null counts/percentages can then be wroked out. Data is then removed/imputed depending on the extent of missing values. Skewed columns are transformed, outliers removed and overly correlated columns removed.
